    "text": "This post focuses on Valentine’s Day spending. The data set contains data for years 2010 to 2022, and the survey asked various questions to consumers on how they planned to celebrate Valentine’s Day. We will investigate the differences in spending between age categories, see if less people are participating in Valentine’s day now than in the past, as well as determine if spending has changed over the years. The data set comes from the tidytuesdayR Github repository (2024, week 7). The data can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-02-13/readme.md"

Has this meant a decrease in spending?"

The average spending per person rose from roughly 100 dollars to 175 dollars from 2010 to 2022. Adjusting for inflation* (shown in red), 175 dollars in 2022 was equivalent to 133 dollars in 2010, so there is still a thirty percent increase even after accounting for inflation. Spending is clearly up, but who is spending the most?\n*Used CPI inflation."

The youngest group (18-24) spend over twice as much money on celebrating compared to the groups over 45 years old. 65+ individuals only spent around 15.\nSome of the analysis was limited because the underlying data and the sample size are not provided with the data set. The summaries and totals were only provided, which hides a lot of the potential spread.\nAs for applying course content, I have chosen appropriate visuals to make for each of the questions, and have modified the theme to make them more readable and appealing. I also calculated by hand the spending adjusted for inflation to more accurately depict the trend in the data in the second visual. Generally, I have applied the concepts from class to build effective and easy to understand visuals."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis blog focuses on a Historical Phone Usage for mobile and land-line phones. The data sets contain 6,267 and 6,964 observation respectively. This blog looks at the adoption of mobile phones in each country from 1990 until 2016. We are looking to examine how different continents adopted mobile technologies. Which continent adopted the quickest and which the slowest? Which continents had the most mobile subscriptions per 100 people in 2016? The data set comes from the tidytuesdayR Github repository (2020, week 46). The data can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-11-10/readme.md.\n\n\nLook at the Dataframe\n\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, week = 46)\nraw_mobile &lt;- tuesdata$mobile\n\n\nhead(raw_mobile)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 7\n  entity      code   year total_pop gdp_per_cap mobile_subs continent\n  &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    \n1 Afghanistan AFG    1990  13032161          NA           0 Asia     \n2 Afghanistan AFG    1991  14069854          NA           0 Asia     \n3 Afghanistan AFG    1992  15472076          NA           0 Asia     \n4 Afghanistan AFG    1993  17053213          NA           0 Asia     \n5 Afghanistan AFG    1994  18553819          NA           0 Asia     \n6 Afghanistan AFG    1995  19789880          NA           0 Asia     \n\n\n\n\nVisualization\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nraw_mobile$mobile_subs[is.na(raw_mobile$mobile_subs)] &lt;- 0\n\ndata_continent &lt;- raw_mobile |&gt;\n  group_by(continent, year) |&gt;\n  summarise(mobile_subs = mean(mobile_subs))\n\n\nggplot(data = data_continent, aes(x = year, y = mobile_subs, color = continent)) + \n  geom_line(linewidth = 2) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Average Number of Phone Subscriptions in Different Countries\",\n       y = \"Average Number of Phone Subscriptions per 100 People\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       color = \"Continent\") + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 20),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),\n        title = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\n\n\nThe visual shows that Asia was the continent to most quickly adopt mobile technology and Africa was the slowest to adopt it. Africa began to really adopt it almost five years after the rest of the continents did. This doesn’t come as much of a surprise. What is more interesting is that Africa has more phones per person than the Oceania region does. I was not expecting this, but it makes sense since Oceania has many islands that probably don’t have a lot of technological innovation. It is clear that the Americas, Europe, and Asia have embraced the new tech with over 100 phones per 100 people on average for all those regions, whereas Africa and Oceania are lagging behind at only roughly 75 and 55 phones per 100 people respectively.\nI this this approach is flawed in a few ways. First is that one cannot see the underlying data or the sample size that is summarized in the graph with only a mean. Additionally, the continent groupings are very broad. The Americas continent is quite large and includes a multitude of countries with different technological footprints. This goes for many of these continents. If I had more time, I’d examine a select a handful countries to compare from different regions, or compare different countries to each other within a region.\nWe have talked about coloring in homework and in class. In the visual, I used a categorical un-ordered color scale for the un-ordered categorical continents. We talked about different plots, and I think this line plot does a good job a representing this data. The plot was also kept simple and clean to avoid unnecessary clutter. For these reasons, I think this an effective visualization to answer the questions at hand."
